# Extra Fish Commands
Additional commands for Fish, implemented through .fish functions. These are mainly here for additional installs of Fish on other systems, but also for yafpm testing, my Git-based package manager for Fish functions.
### Warning!
Most commands save a log file ~/.tmp to track errors and display an error message. These are deleted after the command has run, successfully or not. If you are worried about that, remove the lines from the program
# Current Commands
mkcd - Make a directory, and automatically cd into it.
rd - Removes directories and files recursively without needed additional flags.
